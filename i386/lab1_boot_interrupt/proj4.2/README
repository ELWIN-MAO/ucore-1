1. breakpoint doesn't work, and i don't know why.
ucore kernel cannot receive 'z' or 'Z' message when create/remove a breakpoint.

2. leave some debug messages

3. tools/connect.c run in the background, it can relay message from qemu to gdb, or from gdb to qemu.

gdb uses port 9876 and qemu listens 9875.

tools/connect will wait 2 minutes for qemu and gdb's connections.
if the timeout or some error triggers, it will be quited quietly.

4. if use connect.py, it can print all messages between qemu and gdb.
when i try to set a breakporint, it shows gdb only send some 'm' messages, not 'z' or 'Z'
